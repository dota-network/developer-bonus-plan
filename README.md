# developer-bonus-plan

dota2.0 is a completely decentralized community project. After the mainnet is launched, airdrop rewards will be given to open source code contributors in the Polkadot community to further stimulate technological innovation in the Polkadot ecosystem. We also hope that outstanding developers will join in to jointly create the Dota 2.0 network.
